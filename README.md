# Remix App for StrapiConf 2022 Workshop
## Build a Productivity Tips App with Remix, Render, and Strapi

*This branch is step one. See the other branches in this repository for a description of the code changes made in each step as we build a production Remix app that uses Strapi for its data API.*

1. **Fork** this repository, and then clone the fork locally.
2. `cd` into the cloned directory, and run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Check out the Remix dev server: `npm run dev`. The dev server automatically restarts when you make code changes. View it in your browser at http://localhost:3000/.

Move to the next step with `git checkout step-2` when you're ready. You'll need to first stop the Remix dev server with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> if it's running.

### Development

From your terminal:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.

### Deployment

First, build your app for production:

```sh
npm run build

Then run the app in production mode:
